## Analysis

Overall Positive Correlation with Energy Sources: The majority of countries show a positive correlation between their energy sources and growth in energy consumption per capita. This suggests that, in general, an increase of population per capital will generate increase in enegery.

The majority of countries in the dataset show a strong positive correlation between electricity consumption and some outcome variable. This suggests that as electricity usage increases, there is a significant positive impact on the outcome variable.

Countries from various regions across the globe, including Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania, demonstrate this strong positive correlation with electricity usage. This indicates that the benefits of electricity consumption are widespread and not confined to specific geographical areas.

Multiple countries, including Italy, Iceland, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and others, have strong positive correlations between their electricity production and various outcomes, indicating a consistent pattern of reliance on electricity as a significant energy source.

While some countries have strong positive correlations with other energy sources (e.g., oil products, natural gas), electricity appears to be the predominant energy source with widespread usage across different nations.

CO2 emissions and energy consumption have a very strong positive correlation. This indicates that there is a strong linear relationship between CO2 emissions and energy consumption. In practical terms, this means that as energy consumption increases, CO2 emissions tend to increase as well. China and the US both lead the world in total energy consumption, as well as CO2 emissions, and by a significant amount.

On average, we see a 1.62% increase in CO2 emissions since 1990, with the most recent exponential increase in 2021 with a 5% increase in CO2 emissions compared to the previous year. This large jump can possibly be attributed to COVID-19 occurring in 2020, given a nearly global shutdown and pauses for many largely polluting industries. Given years prior, we can expect a growth rate of about 2% year by year in terms of carbon released into our environment. Looking at energy sources with a lower correlation to CO2 emissions can be a start for countries looking to improve their carbon footprint, as well as modeling after countries with seemingly low CO2 emissions despite energy consumption (Iceland, Sweden, Switzerland, etc.)

## Limitations
Overall, we observed growth in energy sources such as electricity compared to oil and coal, for instance. Despite oil remaining the most used, our visualizations demonstrate the expanding role of electricity. Our analysis has sparked additional follow-up questions worth further exploration.
While cleaning our dataset, we encountered a challenge with data loss, resulting in zero values for the nuclear energy source. However, despite this setback, our project made significant progress. We were still able to effectively highlight oil as the primary energy source currently.

## Further Questions
What energy sources emit the most CO2 into our environment?
What energy source is the most sustainable (least carbon pollution)?
What energy sources are projected to be the most common over the next 20 years given historical data?
How has nuclear energy changed over the last 30 years?
